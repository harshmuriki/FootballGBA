# Football GBA

Idea: A football game where you can control a ball with the arrow keys.
You are the sole person in the your team. With the arrows, control the ball so that it doesn't touch the
borders. If it touches the borders, you lose. If it doesn't touch the borders
and you end up touching the opponents' net, you win. You will have some
amount of time to play. If you do not touch the opponents' net in that time, you lose the game.
Clicking "Backspace" key resets the entire game.
